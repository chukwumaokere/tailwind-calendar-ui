Just a simple Calendar UI similar to that from TailwindCSS'  
Will modify more  
Plan to use for some sites to show some events in a neat way  

TODOS:
- [x] Drag and Drop
- [x] Have drag and drop affect actual data
- [x] Fix drop in same location time changing to user local time
- [ ] Rightclick copy delete menu
- [x] Resize events 
- [ ] Dynamically add/remove events
- [x] Truncate titles in events
- [ ] Style title and subtitle
- [ ] Support multiple months and weeks
- [ ] Sticky header when scrolling through months
- [ ] Swap between list and Calendar?
- [ ] Normalize const rowSpan for 24 hour format 
- [x] Move calendar item to event component
- [x] Add pointer to the event item
- [x] Add links to events
- [x] Allow height adjust
- [x] Add hover effects
- [x] Add hover tooltips
- [ ] Add current day highlight
- [ ] Add more increments to drop time rather than whole hour blocks
