# Tailwind Calendar UI

Just a simple Calendar UI similar to that from TailwindCSS'  
Will modify more  
Plan to use for some sites to show some events in a neat way  

TODOS:
- Drag and Drop
- Resize events 
- Dynamically add/remove events
- Truncate titles in events
- Style title and subtitle
- Support multiple months and weeks
- Sticky header when scrolling through months
- Swap between list and Calendar?
- Normalikze const rowSpan for 24 hour format
