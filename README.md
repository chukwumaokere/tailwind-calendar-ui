Just a simple Calendar UI similar to that from TailwindCSS'  
Will modify more  
Plan to use for some sites to show some events in a neat way  

TODOS:
- [ ] Drag and Drop
- [ ] Resize events 
- [ ] Dynamically add/remove events
- [ ] Truncate titles in events
- [ ] Style title and subtitle
- [ ] Support multiple months and weeks
- [ ] Sticky header when scrolling through months
- [ ] Swap between list and Calendar?
- [ ] Normalikze const rowSpan for 24 hour format 
- [x] Move calendar item to event component
- [x] Add pointer to the event item
- [ ] Add links to events
- [ ] Allow height adjust
